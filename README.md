# CSS Used On My Pages

I was looking for a simple CSS sheet to use with my projects. I forked from 
<https://github.com/jasonm23/markdown-css-themes> and picked a file I liked and modified it
to suite my needs. The modified file is simply called white.css.

The repository I copied from was in the public domain and so my modified version is also.

## White.css has been used in my Web Pages

See <http://www3.telus.net/danpeirce/notes/python_markdown.html>

I expect I will be modifying that page soon.
